🧩 1. Docker container processes vs. host processes
=======================================================

👨‍💻 Imagine this:

You run this on your Ubuntu host:

docker run ubuntu sleep 1000
You're thinking:

"A process is running inside the container… but where is it? How is it different from a normal Linux process?"

✅ Here’s the truth:

Every container is just a regular Linux process on your host machine — but isolated.

🔒 “Isolated” = Limited visibility and access
The container lives on your computer, but it’s isolated from:

	Other containers

	The host system (your real Ubuntu OS)

	Other users/processes on the host

	Host’s network interfaces, file systems, and PIDs
	
🏠 Analogy:
------------

Imagine your host machine (Ubuntu) is like a big house.

Now, inside that house, Docker sets up separate rooms (containers). Each room:

Has its own furniture (files, network, processes)

Can’t see what’s in other rooms

Thinks it’s the whole house (because of namespaces)

Shares the same floor (kernel) but with limited permissions

So containers are not on some separate server — they’re right there, in your Ubuntu system, just in isolated boxes with walls around them.


You can see container processes on your host using:

ps aux

or

top

BUT — inside the container, it only sees its own processes. It doesn't know about the host's other stuff.

🤯 How does Docker isolate processes?

That’s where namespaces come in.

🧱 2. What are namespaces?
============================

Think of namespaces like “blinders” for containers.
They hide parts of the system — so each container thinks it’s alone in the world.

Docker uses Linux namespaces to isolate:

| Namespace Type | What It Hides                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `pid`          | Process IDs                   |
| `net`          | Network interfaces (e.g. IPs) |
| `mnt`          | Mount points (filesystems)    |
| `uts`          | Hostname                      |
| `ipc`          | Shared memory                 |
| `user`         | User/Group IDs                |

💡 Example: PID Namespace
----------------------------

On the host, a container process might be PID 4123

But inside the container, it sees itself as PID 1

This prevents PID collisions/confusions, and makes each container feel like it has its own OS.


🧰 3. What are cgroups in Docker?
===================================

Now namespaces are about what a container can see…
But cgroups are about how much it can use.

💡 cgroups = control groups

They limit and track a container’s:

| Resource     | Example                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| CPU          | Only use 1 core out of 4 |
| Memory (RAM) | Max 256 MB               |
| Disk I/O     | Slow down disk access    |
| Network      | (advanced use)           |

🏗 How Docker uses cgroups:
-----------------------------

When you run:

docker run --memory=256m ubuntu

sDocker uses Linux cgroups to:

Enforce the 256MB RAM limit

Prevent that container from crashing your whole system

You can also see limits with:

docker stats

| Feature     | Purpose                              | Technology Used |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Isolation   | Hides host resources from containers | **Namespaces**  |
| Control     | Limits container resource usage      | **cgroups**     |
| Convenience | Makes containers feel like mini-VMs  | Linux Kernel    |


Q and A
========

Q: so cgropus and namespaces are not related to docker it is related to linux?

A:

🧠 Here’s how it works:

🧱 1. Namespaces → Isolation
-----------------------------

Feature of the Linux kernel

Lets the system isolate "views" of resources like:

	Process IDs (PID)

	Network interfaces

	Mount points (filesystems)

	Users

	Hostnames

👉 Used by Docker, but not made by Docker.

⚖️ 2. Cgroups (Control Groups) → Resource control
-----------------------------------------------------

Also a Linux kernel feature

Allows the system to limit or monitor resources used by processes:

	CPU

	Memory

	Disk I/O

	Network

Again — Docker just uses it, it didn’t create it.

🐳 So what’s Docker’s role?
---------------------------------

Docker is like a friendly interface that says:

"Hey Linux, please isolate this process using namespaces, and limit it using cgroups."

It simplifies things for you. Instead of doing:

mount --make-rprivate /
unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc bash
cgcreate -g memory,cpu:mygroup

...you just write:

docker run -m 256m --cpus=1 ubuntu

✅ Easy! Docker hides the Linux complexity under the hood.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: so if docker creates namespaces for me , lets say i want to create a namespace for my work and i have to crete it manually how to do that?

A:

Fantastic question! 💡 Yes — Docker makes your life easy by creating namespaces for you, but under the hood it’s just using raw Linux namespace features.

If you want to manually create your own namespaces without Docker — yes, you can do that using Linux tools like:

	unshare

	nsenter
	
	clone (in C code)

	ip netns (for network namespaces)


👇 Let’s try a simple demo (manually creating a process in a new namespace)

We’ll use the unshare command.

✅ Example 1: Create a new UTS and PID namespace

Run this:

sudo unshare --pid --uts --fork bash


What this does:

--pid: new process namespace (your shell will see PID 1)

--uts: new hostname namespace (you can set a custom hostname)

--fork: start a new process in this isolated space

bash: open a new bash shell inside the namespace

🧪 Inside the new shell:
Try this:

hostname new-namespace
hostname  # should now show "new-namespace"
ps        # should only show a few processes

You are now inside a tiny world, just like a container! 🧪

so in short namapse definition is that:

" A namespace in Linux is a kernel feature that isolates a set of system resources (like process IDs, network interfaces, hostnames, etc.) so that one group of processes cannot see or affect resources used by another group. "
