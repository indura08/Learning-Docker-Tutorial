When you install Docker on Windows, you're actually installing Docker Desktop, and yes — it runs a Linux virtual machine under the hood (if you're using Linux containers).

🪟 So what actually happens when you install Docker on Windows?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. You install Docker Desktop for Windows

	It’s a GUI + service that manages everything for you

	It includes Docker Engine, CLI, Compose, etc.

2. Under the hood:

	It uses WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2)

		Or in older versions, a Hyper-V Linux VM

	It spins up a real Linux kernel inside WSL 2

	Your containers run inside that Linux environment, not on native Windows


💡 So am I running Docker on Windows?
---------------------------------------

Technically no — you're running Docker inside Linux (via WSL2), but using Windows tools to control it.

You use docker commands in PowerShell or CMD or Windows Terminal — but those commands talk to the Linux-based Docker engine in WSL2.

🧠 What is WSL2?
-----------------

WSL2 is a super-efficient way to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows, without the heavy VM overhead.

It gives you a full Linux environment (like Ubuntu or Alpine) running almost natively.


🐳 Container Type Switch
--------------------------

In Docker Desktop, you’ll see this option:

	"Use the WSL 2 based engine" or "Switch to Windows containers"

So by default, you’re using Linux containers inside WSL2, but you can switch to Windows containers if you really want.

But note:

	Most containers in the world are Linux-based

	So Linux containers + WSL2 is the best choice for 99% of use cases



Q: so cant i install docker to use directly windows host kernel?

A: 

Great question again — and the short, honest answer is:

No, you cannot use the Windows host kernel directly for running Linux containers with Docker.

But let’s explain why, in very simple terms:


💡 Linux Containers ≠ Windows Kernel
------------------------------------------

	Docker containers (like the official Node, Python, Ubuntu images) are Linux containers.

	They need a Linux kernel to run.

	The Windows kernel is completely different — it can't run Linux binaries or containers directly.

So Docker needs a Linux kernel to work. And since Windows doesn't have that, Docker uses:

WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) — preferred

Or Hyper-V — in older setups

That’s how Docker pretends there’s a Linux system running on Windows.


🧪 But  what  about  Windows containers?
------------------------------------
Ahh! Now we’re talking:

You can run Windows containers using the Windows kernel directly. 
But there are big limitations:

Only Windows-specific containers (not Linux ones)

Fewer available base images

Bigger size, slower builds

Not cross-platform (can’t run them on Linux/Mac)

To do this, you have to switch Docker Desktop into Windows container mode:

" # right-click Docker icon in system tray -> "Switch to Windows containers" "


⚖️ Summary:  Can you run Docker containers on Windows without Linux kernel?

Use Case						Possible?	Notes

Run Linux containers using Windows kernel		❌ No		Needs Linux kernel, which Windows doesn’t have
Run Linux containers using WSL2			✅ Yes		This is the default for Docker Desktop
Run Windows containers using Windows kernel	✅ Yes		But very limited use cases and support
