📘 Docker exec vs -it (Simple Explanation)
---------------------------------------------

🔹 docker run -it
--------------------

Used to start a new container interactively.

-i = Keep input open

-t = Allocate a terminal (so the output looks like a normal shell)

You can type commands inside the container.

✅ Example:

docker run -it ubuntu

This will:

Start a new container from the Ubuntu image.

Give you access to a shell inside it.

🔹 docker exec -it
-------------------------
Used to run a command inside an already running container.

exec means: "Hey, I want to execute something inside this container."

-it still means interactive terminal.

✅ Example:

docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash

This will:

Connect you to a running container.

Start a new bash session inside it.

🔁 Main Differences:
----------------------
| Feature               | `docker run -it`                   | `docker exec -it`                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Starts new container? | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No (uses an already running one)         |
| Runs a command?       | ✅ Yes                              | ✅ Yes                                      |
| Good for?             | Starting new interactive container | Running commands inside existing container |
| Example               | `docker run -it ubuntu`            | `docker exec -it myapp bash`               |

🧠 Summary:
------------

Use docker run -it to start a brand new container interactively.

Use docker exec -it to enter or run something inside a container that is already running.
