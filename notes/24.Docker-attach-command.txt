The docker attach command connects your terminal to a running container’s main process, so you can see its output and interact with it — almost like you're “jumping into” the live container session.

🧠 In Simple Terms:
--------------------

Think of it like this:

You started a container earlier. Now you want to watch what it’s doing or interact with it, without starting a new one.

That's where docker attach comes in.

Syntax: " docker attach <container_id or name> "

✅ What Happens When You Run It:
----------------------------------

You’ll see the container’s stdout (output) and stderr (errors).

If the container is running something like a terminal (e.g., Bash or a server), you can interact with it.

🧨 BUT WARNING:
When you're attached, if you press Ctrl + C, it may stop the container, because it sends a SIGINT (interrupt) to the container's main process.

✅ To Avoid That (Best Practice):
Instead, use:

docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

That gives you an interactive terminal inside the container, without affecting the main process.

👀 Example:

docker run -it ubuntu
# (container starts and you're inside it)

# Open a new terminal:
docker ps
docker attach <that_container_id>

Now you're connected and watching the same output.
