ðŸ¤” Why Do We Use Nginx for Angular or React Apps?
==================================================

ðŸ”¹ 1. Frontend frameworks build static files

When you build a React or Angular app (npm run build), it generates static files like:

index.html

main.js, styles.css

Images, fonts, etc.

These static files can't run themselves â€” they need to be served to a browser by a web server.


ðŸ”¹ 2. Nginx = Fast, lightweight web server

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is:

Super fast

Low memory

Easy to configure

Widely used in production

It's ideal for serving static files efficiently and routing requests.


âœ… Do You Have To Use Nginx?

ðŸ‘‰ In Development?
No. You can use:

ng serve for Angular

npm start or vite for React

These come with development servers (like webpack-dev-server or Vite).

ðŸ‘‰ In Production?
Yes, usually. You need something to:

Serve the static files

Handle routing (like Angular/React paths)

Possibly do caching, compression, etc.

Thatâ€™s where Nginx shines. Other options (less common):

Apache

Node.js + express.static

Firebase Hosting

AWS S3 with CloudFront
