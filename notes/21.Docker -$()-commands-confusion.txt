✅ First: What does this do?

docker stop $(docker ps -q)

You're telling Docker:

"Stop all running containers."

But how? What's that $(docker ps -q) part doing?

🧠 What is $(...) in Linux/bash?
----------------------------------

This is called command substitution.

It runs the command inside the parentheses and replaces it with the result/output.

So:

$(docker ps -q)

means:

“Run docker ps -q and insert its output right here.”

✅ What does docker ps -q do?
------------------------------

Let’s break it down:

	docker ps → lists all running containers in a table format.

	-q → means "quiet mode" → it will only show container IDs, nothing else.

docker ps -q

Might output something like:

f3c52a1ad18e
b6d41b9f5e5a

These are the IDs of your running containers.

🔁 So what happens when you run this?
---------------------------------------

docker stop $(docker ps -q)

Let’s say docker ps -q gives:

abc123 def456

Then the full command becomes:

docker stop abc123 def456

Which just stops all those container
