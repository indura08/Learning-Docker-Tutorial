⚙️ 1. Deeper Explanation of Docker Architecture (Under the Hood)
------------------------------------------------------------------

You're right — there’s more going on under the Docker Client and Daemon. Here's a breakdown:

🧩 Main Components:

✅ 1. Docker Client
The CLI or GUI tool (like Docker Desktop).

Sends commands (build, run, pull, push) to the Docker Daemon using a REST API over HTTP/Unix socket.

Thin interface — it doesn’t do any real work.

✅ 2. Docker Daemon (dockerd)
The brain of Docker.

It:

Manages images and containers.

Talks to container runtime.

Exposes a REST API (/var/run/docker.sock on Linux).

🔍 Inside the Daemon:
Image Manager: Pulls, builds, and stores Docker images.

Container Manager: Creates and manages containers.

Storage Driver: Handles image layers (more on that soon).

Network Manager: Handles container networking (bridge, host, overlay).

Volume Manager: Manages data storage volumes.

✅ 3. Container Runtime (containerd)
Docker doesn’t directly run containers anymore — it delegates to containerd (standard container runtime).

containerd talks to runc (the low-level tool that sets up namespaces/cgroups to launch the actual container).

📌 So in order:
Docker Client → Docker Daemon → containerd → runc → Container


🖼 4. Docker Images and Layers
Docker images are built in layers, like a layered cake 🎂.

Each Dockerfile instruction creates a new layer (like RUN, COPY, etc.).

These layers are stacked, and Docker caches them (we’ll explain this next).


💾 2. Docker Caching (and why it matters)
--------------------------------------------
Docker caching is what makes rebuilds fast and efficient. Here's how it works:

🔄 Docker Build Cache:
When you run docker build, Docker remembers each instruction it’s already built before (if nothing has changed).

It checks:

The instruction itself

The context (e.g., files used in COPY)

✅ If nothing changed, Docker reuses the previously built layer from cache.
❌ If something changes, Docker invalidates that layer and everything after it.

🔥 Why does this matter?
Let’s say you have this Dockerfile:

FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "index.js"]


🧠 Cache behavior:
FROM node:18 — uses cached base image if it hasn’t changed ✅

WORKDIR /app — same directory? cache hit ✅

COPY package.json . — same file content? cache hit ✅

RUN npm install — if package.json is unchanged, cache hit ✅

COPY . . — even a tiny change in one file will invalidate cache ❌

CMD — always runs, but doesn't affect the image itself

So a tiny change in your source code can cause the later layers to be rebuilt and not use cache.
