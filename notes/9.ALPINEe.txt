Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox. It's designed for simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for Docker images due to its small size. When referring to "Alpine" in the context of Docker, it usually means using the Alpine Linux base image to create Docker containers.
