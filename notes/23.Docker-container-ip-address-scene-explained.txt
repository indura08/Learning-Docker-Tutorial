🧠 Why does a Docker container get an IP address?
--------------------------------------------------

When you run a container, Docker creates a mini private network inside your system — like a "little internet" just for containers.

Each container:

Joins this private network.

Gets its own internal IP address (like 172.17.0.2).

Can talk to other containers over this private network using that IP.

So just like your computer has an IP on your Wi-Fi, your container has an IP inside Docker's virtual network.

🧪 Example:
Let’s say you run two containers:

docker run -d --name app1 nginx
docker run -d --name app2 httpd

Each will get a Docker-assigned IP:

app1: 172.17.0.2

app2: 172.17.0.3

Now inside the containers, they can ping or talk to each other using these IPs.

🧭 Why is this useful?
------------------------

Containers can communicate with each other directly (microservices style).

You can build isolated systems like a database container + app container talking privately.

You don’t have to expose ports to your host unless you want outside access.

🔐 Security bonus:
-------------------

These IPs are not accessible from outside your computer unless you use -p to map ports.

This isolation makes containers more secure and prevents port conflicts.
